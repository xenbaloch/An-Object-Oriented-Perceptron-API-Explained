# An Object Oriented Perceptron API-Explained
I tried to rewrite and explain the following part of the code originally written in book Python Machine Learning 2nd Edition by Sebastian Rashka and Vahid Mirjalili. 

The purpose of rewriting the code and explaining it is entirely for education, as some of the students (following the code way it is written and implemented) may find it difficult to follow it comfortably for some of the terms are skipped or not explained well assuming the readers have fair knowledge of the terms and methods being used in implementation. 

So, I tried to explain it to get the readers solid understanding. However, it is my personal attempt and may not be as good as one may have expected it to be, so you are welcome to give feedback and contribute in it.

More content will be uploaded time to time. 

Thank you!
